# üéÆ 2D Java Game  

Welcome to my first 2D Java game! This project is a simple game designed to demonstrate the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java while combining creativity and problem-solving. üöÄ  

I started this project to bridge the gap between theory and application, using both self-written code and open-source inspiration.  

## ‚ú® Features  
- **Player Movement:** Control the player with basic keyboard inputs.  
- **Obstacle Interaction:** Avoid or interact with on-screen elements.  
- **OOP Architecture:** Organized code using classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.  
- **Game Loop:** Smooth gameplay experience with a basic game loop logic.  

## üöß Future Roadmap  
This game is a work in progress! Here‚Äôs what I plan to add in future iterations:  
- **Item Collection:** Pick up items to increase score or unlock abilities.  
- **NPCs:** Introduce non-player characters for added interactivity.  
- **Levels and Challenges:** Multiple levels with increasing difficulty.  
- **Improved Graphics:** Enhance the visual appeal with sprites and animations.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- **Java**: Core programming language.  
- **Open-Source Libraries**: Incorporated useful code snippets from the community.  


## How to Run this file :
- 1. Clone this repository : download the zip file or use the github desktop to clone
- open src folder and run the **Main** method in **Main** Folder



Do Drop in your suggestions and I would be happy to add them up as a feature!
